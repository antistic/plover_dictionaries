# Steno dictionaries and stuff

My collection of dictionaries and other steno stuff.

All of this is a continual work in progress.

Check each dictionary file for documentation.

### Q. What are these `.py` dictionaries?

**A.** They are dictionaries written in python, which makes it easy to define a dictionary programmatically. It's super useful for definitions that follow set patterns. You'll need to install the [python dictionary plugin](https://pypi.org/project/plover-python-dictionary/) to use them.


### Q. What are these `.md` dictionaries?

**A.** They are dictionaries written in markdown. You'll need my experimental [markdown dictionary plugin](https://github.com/antistic/plover_markdown_dictionary) to use them. It lets me write comments around definitions in full markdown, and I can also define inline comments.
